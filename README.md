# gira-libv2

This is version to the python library I created to interact with my X1/S1 Gira server.

This library implements the full scope of the REST interface as described by the [GPA Project Interface Documentation](https://github.com/brendanbank/gira-libv2/blob/c8993841cf787944a9087aa905c05484d40ae7cd/GiraDocumentation/GPA_Project_Interface_Documentation.pdf)

A couple of features:
* Login through the S1 remote access functionality
* Download configuration and create a internal memory structure to get and set values on the X1.
